2. Optionally, create a virtual environment for your project before running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Obtain your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey). You can set it up by running `echo "API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" > .env` or by creating a .env file and adding the API key directly.
